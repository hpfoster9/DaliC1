### Overall
```
The main page was used primarily with bootstrap. I began with a template and customized it from there. The I had a few problems with my project page initially because I had my video files loaded directly from my project and git rejected them for being too large. I compromised then, by uploading the videos to youtube and embedding them in my page. On the Instagram page, I decided to try out a third-party API I found called "Pixlee". Additionally, I had never used a parallax background before and so I decided to test it out.
