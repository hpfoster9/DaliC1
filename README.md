### Overall
```
The main page was used primarily with bootstrap. 
I began with a template and customized it from there. 
```
### Problems
```
I had a few problems with my project page initially 
because I had my video files loaded directly from my 
project and git rejected them for being too large. 
I compromised then, by uploading the videos to youtube
and embedding them in my page. 
Additionally, the page is not very responsive and is best seen via computer
```
### New Tech
```
On the Instagram page, I decided to try out a third-party
API I found called "Pixlee". 
Additionally, I had never used a parallax background
before and so I decided to test it out.
